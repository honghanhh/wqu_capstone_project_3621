        "The objective of this project is to develop a predictive model for Bitcoin (BTC) price using a Probabilistic Graphical Model (PGM). By leveraging the power of PGMs, we aim to identify the key sentiment, financial, technical, and on-chain factors that significantly influence the price of BTC. This analysis will provide valuable insights for swing traders looking to make informed trading decisions.\n",

        "The project encompasses the following goals:\n",
        "\n",
        "**Factor Identification**: We will carefully analyze a diverse set of sentiment, financial, technical, and on-chain metrics to identify the most influential factors affecting the price of BTC. By understanding these factors, we can gain deeper insights into the market dynamics.\n",
        "\n",
        "**PGM Construction**: Using the identified factors, we will construct a sophisticated Probabilistic Graphical Model. This model will capture the complex relationships and dependencies among the factors, allowing us to make accurate predictions about future BTC price movements.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Performance Comparison**: To demonstrate the effectiveness of our PGM-based approach, we will compare its performance against a mean-reverting strategy. By evaluating and contrasting the outcomes of both approaches, we aim to showcase the viability and potential advantages of our predictive model.\n",
        "\n",
        "By achieving these objectives, we seek to provide traders and investors with a valuable tool for making informed decisions in the dynamic and volatile world of cryptocurrency trading."

By examining the color-coded portions that represent each regime, we can get a better understanding of the effectiveness of our regime detection methodology."

Our directed graph plot revealed that only two variables, namely Bitcoin (BTC) price and Market Capitalization, demonstrated the ability to predict the BTC price. On the other hand, other variables did not establish any connection with price prediction, indicating that our PGM's learned structure lacked predictive power beyond the BTC price.\n",

We plan to achieve this by introducing additional variables such as technical indicators, on-chain, financial, and sentimental data, and identifying the most predictive features. Furthermore, we intend to employ other Structure learning approaches such as PC and Exhaustive Search, or a hybrid of constraint and score-based learning. Additionally, we plan to utilize different techniques for parameter learning. \n",
